        <p>Bio (courtesy of website):</p><br>

        <p>Originally from a sleepy mountain town, I now run my graphic design and illustration studio from Calgary, Canada. My focus is creating thoughtful, memorable work for brands, publications, and agencies across North America. (And other places, too!)</p><br>
