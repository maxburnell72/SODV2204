            Kims Favorite team was always the Chicago Bulls. The greatest chicago bulls team and the one kim watched gowing up who won the three championships was the one dennis rodman played on 
            who was also Kims Favorite player. After the NBA Dennis played for the harlem globrtotters 3 of witch took a trip with vice news to viisit the communist dictator. The 2 got along very well and 
            Dennis told kim that he will always have a freind for life and From there the freindship blossomed. Since then dennis has flown out numerous times to visit his good friend Kim and apparently
            Hangout all the time. They Have gone skiing togehter riden horse together, Sang kerokee, Watched basket ball and played basketball. The 2 have remained freinds for years and Dennis has also helped
